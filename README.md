# averages-2csvFiles
 This R project was designed to take two different csv files and find the averages of the values into those files.

I am analizing 3D coordinates on ct-scanned Caiman specimens. I collected those coordinates using 3D Slicer (

Magnetic Resonance Imaging. 2012 Nov;30(9):1323-41. PMID: 22770690. PMCID: PMC3466397.)

Each specimen was measured twice and I got 2 .csv files.
I need to calculate the averages of each couple of files (2 for specimen).

I developed this script and some functions in order to achieve that goal.
